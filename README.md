# week-4-game
This is a simple yet fun game I made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the CSS I used Twitter Bootstrap which helped with the speed in which I built the game, as well as the Mobile Responsiveness. I also used jQuery for the JS file, which made it easy to select certain HTML Elements and manipulate the game. I also added sound effects on the Gem Buttons which gave the game a little more style.

The rules of the game are very simple, at the start of each round there is a randomly generated "Goal Number", this is the number the user wants to get to. Each one of the Gems will each have a random value at the start of each game as well. If the user matches the "Goal Number" exactly they win, if the go over the number they lose.
